<h2>Finance Calculator</h2>

In this capstone project I was tasked with creating a program that allows users to calculate their interest on an investment or calculate the amount that should be repaid on a home loan each month.

The user is given the choice of either "investment" - to caluclate the interest on their investment or "bond" - to calculate the amount to pay on a home loan. 

If the user selects "investment", they will be asked to enter:
<ol>
  <li>The amount they are depositing</li>
  <li>The interest rate (as a percentage)</li>
  <li>The number of years they wish to invest</li>
  <li>If they want simple or compound interest</li>
</ol>

The calculated appropriate amount will then be displayed to the user. 

If the user selects "bond", they will be asked to enter:
<ol>
  <li>The value of the house</li>
  <li>The interest rate</li>
  <li>The number of months they plan to take to repay the bond</li>
</ol>

The calculated total they will have to pay each month is then displayed to the user.
