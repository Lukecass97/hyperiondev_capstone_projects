<h2>Task Manager</h2>

In this capstone project I was tasked with refactoring code in a program designed for a small business to help manage tasks assigned to each member of a team.

The admin has special access to the program, with more options available to them than a regular user.

The admin user has ability to:
<ol>
  <li>Register a user</li>
  <li>Add a task</li>
  <li>View all tasks</li>
  <li>View my tasks</li>
  <li>Generate reports</li>
  <li>Display statistics</li>
</ol>

If a new user is registered, the new user data is added to the text file "user.txt".
If a new task is added, the new task is added to the text file "tasks.txt".
If the generate reports option is selected, two text files are generated: "user_overview.txt" and "task_overview.txt" and these files output the data contained in a user-friendly manner.

The non-admin user has the ability to:
<ol>
  <li>Add a task</li>
  <li>View all tasks</li>
  <li>View my tasks</li>
</ol>

The user is able to mark a task assigned to them as complete or edit a task assigned to them by editing the username of the person the task is assigned to or the due date of the task.
