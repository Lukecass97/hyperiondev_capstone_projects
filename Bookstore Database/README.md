<h2>Bookstore Database</h2>

In this capstone project I was tasked with creating a database program for a bookstore. The database contains two tables, being "book" - containing data about the books and "author" - containing data about the author. The program allows users to perform different functions with regard to the books and authors in the database. 

The program allows the user to:
<ol>
  <li>Enter a new book</li>
  <li>Update book</li>
  <li>Update author details</li>
  <li>Delete book</li>
  <li>Search books</li>
  <li>View details of all books</li>
  <li>Backup database</li>
  <li>Restore database</li>
</ol>

All output is displayed in a user-friendly manner.
