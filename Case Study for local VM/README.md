<h2>Case Study for local VM</h2>

In this capstone project I was tasked with attempting to gain unauthorised access to an internal network. The assessment was completed in 4 stages.

Stage 1:
<ul>
  <li>Use netdiscover to find the IP address of the VM</li>
  <li>Use nmap to list the services that are running on open ports</li>
</ul>

Stage 2:
<ul>
  <li>Do research on the services found in stage 1 to identify a backdoor vulnerability</li>
</ul>

Stage 3:
<ul>
  <li>Exploit the backdoor vulnerability found in stage 2</li>
</ul>

Stage 4:
<ul>
  <li>Extract the password file found</li>
  <li>Login to the VM - gaining unathourised access</li>
</ul>
