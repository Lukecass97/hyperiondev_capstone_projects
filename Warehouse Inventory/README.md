<h2>Warehouse Inventory</h2>

In this capstone project I was tasked with creating a python program that improves organisation for stock-taking at multiple Nike warehouses. 

The text file "inventory.txt" contains the following information about each shoe:
<ol>
  <li>Country where the shoe is stocked</li>
  <li>The shoe code</li>
  <li>The shoe name</li>
  <li>The cost of the shoe</li>
  <li>The quantity of the shoe</li>
</ol>

The program enables users to do the following:
<ol>
  <li>Add a shoe</li>
  <li>View all shoes</li>
  <li>Determine the shoe with the lowest quantity and restock it</li>
  <li>Search for a specific shoe by entering the shoe code</li>
  <li>See the total value of each shoe</li>
  <li>See the highest quantity shoe</li>
</ol>

If the user adds a shoe, all shoe information is appended to the text file "inventory.txt". All output is displayed in a user-friendly manner.
